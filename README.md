# Introduction 
The CovertComm project advances secure and private communication by utilizing both Steganography and encryption to embed secret messages in the TCP/IP packets. The core ambition is to embed secret messages in the header fields of network packets, thereby rendering encrypted communications indistinguishable from regular network traffic, and designing an intuitive user interface that abstracts the underlying complexities from the end-user.
